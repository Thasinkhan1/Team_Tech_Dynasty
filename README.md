* Important Note:-
Disclaimer: This code is intended as an outline for demonstration purposes only. It serves as a basic template and should be expanded and adjusted according to the specific needs of your project,
including proper data handling,feature engineering, model tuning, and performance evaluation.

* EEG Signal Analysis for Attention Identification Using LSTM:-
This project demonstrates an EEG signal analysis pipeline using LSTM models to identify attention levels.
It includes data loading, preprocessing (band-pass filtering), feature scaling, model building, training, and evaluation.

* Overview:-
Objective: To classify attention levels from EEG signals using an LSTM neural network.
Data: The EEG data is assumed to be in CSV format, with signals as features and attention levels as labels.
* Techniques Used:-
Band-Pass Filtering: To isolate relevant frequency ranges in EEG data.
LSTM Model: For sequential data processing to capture temporal dependencies in EEG signals.
