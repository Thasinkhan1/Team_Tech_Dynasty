# EEG Signal Analysis for Attention Identification Using LSTM

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used in this project comprises EEG signals collected from subjects to analyze their attention levels. EEG data typically includes continuous recordings of brain wave activity, measured from various electrodes placed on the scalp. For this project, the data is provided in CSV format, where each row represents a time point with features corresponding to different EEG channels and a label indicating the attention level.

The dataset may be obtained from publicly available sources or recorded in a controlled environment, capturing brain activity under specific conditions. The data may include various artifacts and noise, which requires preprocessing and cleaning to ensure accurate analysis. Real-time EEG data handling introduces additional complexities such as streaming data management and real-time processing requirements.

This project outlines a simplified approach to EEG signal analysis using LSTM models to identify attention levels. The provided code serves as a demonstration and is intended to give an overview of the key steps involved in the process.

## Overview

**Objective:** To classify attention levels from EEG signals using an LSTM neural network.

**Data:** The EEG data is assumed to be in CSV format, with signals as features and attention levels as labels. EEG data can also be collected in real-time, providing a continuous stream of brain activity data. Real-time EEG data enables dynamic monitoring and analysis of cognitive states, but handling such data requires additional considerations like data acquisition, real-time processing, and latency management.

**Techniques Used:**
- **Band-Pass Filtering:** To isolate relevant frequency ranges in EEG data.
- **LSTM Model:** For sequential data processing to capture temporal dependencies in EEG signals.

## Important Note

**Disclaimer:** This code is intended as an outline for demonstration purposes only. It serves as a basic template and should be expanded and adjusted according to the specific needs of your project, including proper data handling, feature engineering, model tuning, and performance evaluation.
