# EEG Signal Analysis for Attention Identification Using LSTM

This project outlines a simplified approach to EEG signal analysis using LSTM models to identify attention levels. The provided code serves as a demonstration and is intended to give an overview of the key steps involved in the process.

## Overview

**Objective:** To classify attention levels from EEG signals using an LSTM neural network.

**Data:** The EEG data is assumed to be in CSV format, with signals as features and attention levels as labels.

**Techniques Used:**
- **Band-Pass Filtering:** To isolate relevant frequency ranges in EEG data.
- **LSTM Model:** For sequential data processing to capture temporal dependencies in EEG signals.

## Important Note

**Disclaimer:** This code is intended as an outline for demonstration purposes only. It serves as a basic template and should be expanded and adjusted according to the specific needs of your project, including proper data handling, feature engineering, model tuning, and performance evaluation.
